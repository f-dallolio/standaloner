=======================================================

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `standaloner` is to provide simple stand-in functions for common programming tasks that minimize dependencies and are based on base R functions as much as possible.

They are not intended as replacements of the original functions but simply as helpers during package development.

Most of these functions are "borrowed" or inspired by the `standalone-XYZ.R` functions found in the [rlang Github](https://github.com/r-lib/rlang/tree/main/R) repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of standaloner from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("f-dallolio/standaloner")
```
